# ATM_Project

<b>About:</b>
<br> The ATM Project was a lesson in implementing and maintining state. We were tasked with improving the interface. I chose to add an alert when you enter in an amount that will be an overdraft. Some basic stylizations on the page layout and color coordinating the withdrawl and deposit buttons.
